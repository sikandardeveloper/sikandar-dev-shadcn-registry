<Steps>

1. **Search Existing Issues**

    Review the <a href={`${PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_URL}/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement`}>GitHub issues</a> to see if the feature has already been requested.

2. **Open a Issue**

    Go to the GitHub repository and <a href={`${PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_URL}/issues`}>open a new issue</a> using the `Feature Request` template.

3. **Describe the Feature**

    Explain the motivation, expected behavior, and possible alternatives. The more detailed a request is, the easier it is for maintainers to understand and implement.

</Steps>

_This is not for requesting new components. For that, please see [Component Request](/contributing/component-request)._
